# 2DPlatformerPlayerMechanics
This contains code from my personal 2d platformer project. I invested a lot of time in implementing player mechanics and integrating various mechanics toghether.

## Player Mechanics Included:
Movement : Walk, Run, movement on slope.  
Jump, Air Jump.  
8-directional Dash.  
Wall Slide, Wall Grab, and Wall Jump of 3 types.  
Grapple mechanics.  

Uses Unity's Input System.  
Uses Script Seperation technique which allows for writing different mechanics in different scripts which depend on one another.  
I have added various sublte features that make the game feel better such as Jump Buffer, Coyote Time, JumpApex Modulation and much more.
